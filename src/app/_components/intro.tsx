      {/*I decided to create this blog because there are a lot of topics that I would like to write about, in a slightly more formal setting, to better articulate my thoughts and more importantly, my queries and curiosities about these topics. I work in the field of AI, ML and technology and there are many things about this field that I would like to learn about, as even in a somewhat general role, I donâ€™t have the time and space to explore all of them in my job or studies. I think a lot about how our society currently is, and how we can improve it, and I would like to explore rigorously, statistically and philosophically, where we are and where we can go. I want to go through solutions and problems. I am fascinated by energy, as the core of what makes our society function - agricultural prices are defined by energy markets, similarly with manufacturing, technology, if we cannot solve our technical and social problems with energy, we face a much darker future. This is a place for me to explore subjects I want to learn more about, and reflect on the world around me. I could have kept this private, but I think writing to an imaginary audience enforces a level of rigour that is otherwise hard to motivate. I hope that some of my writings may even help other people in their contemplations and curiosities about these topics. I hope you enjoy this journey as much as I am. */}
